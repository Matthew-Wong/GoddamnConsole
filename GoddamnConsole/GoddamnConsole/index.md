GoddamnConsole is a .NET library for building user interface in console, similar to Windows Forms.

## Platform Support

GoddamnConsole uses native console providers, which abstract library from platform-dependent code.
Only Windows provider supported now, but Linux provider will be written soon (or you can write it by yourself)
